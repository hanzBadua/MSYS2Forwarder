# MSYS2 Forwarder
Do you ever use MSYS2, and get absolutely pissed because there's no context menu entries? (which is a MUST if you use git on msys2 instead of git-for-windows, like I do)

Or how when you pin each MSYS shell to your taskbar, it takes up 3 entries? 

Well - this program is an easy, simple solution. Create MSYS2 context menu entries with ease, then create a shortcut + pin this program to your taskbar, to access all MSYS2 shells neatly.

(requires .NET Framework 4.8, Windows 10 already comes with .NET 4.8)
